# 2025_Shared_Mooring_Optimization_Floating_Wind  
AI-Assisted Evaluation of Shared Mooring Systems in Deepwater Floating Wind Farms

*This repository hosts the technical resources and analysis results for a demonstration project focused on optimizing mooring configurations for floating offshore wind farms (FOWFs). The project compares baseline vs. shared anchor-line systems through a simulation-driven, AI-supported framework.*

---


## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a simulation-based, data-driven system to compare **baseline mooring systems** (independent anchors per turbine) with **shared mooring configurations** (interconnected lines and shared anchors) in **deepwater floating offshore wind farms (FOWFs)**.

The project investigates cost-efficiency, environmental impact, dynamic coupling behavior, and failure resilience, aiming to provide actionable recommendations for next-generation FOWF development.

## ⚙️ Technical Overview

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Mooring systems account for a substantial portion of FOWF costs. Traditional configurations are often redundant and environmentally intensive. However, shared mooring systems—while potentially more efficient—introduce complexity due to platform coupling and non-linear dynamics.

This project simulates both configurations under standardized assumptions and uses AI-inspired scoring metrics to evaluate:

- Total system cost  
- Anchor and line requirements  
- Seabed disturbance footprint  
- Coupling penalty and risk  
- Scalability and resilience trade-offs

---

## 🧠 Technical Solution: Key Highlights

- Two configurations modeled:
  - **Baseline:** 3 lines + 3 anchors per turbine  
  - **Shared:** 1.5 lines + 1.5 anchors per turbine  
- Key metrics calculated:
  - 💰 Total Estimated Cost  
  - 🌱 Seabed Footprint (m²)  
  - 🔄 Dynamic Coupling Penalty  
  - ⚠️ Risk Index (1 to 5 scale)  
- Outputs:
  - 📄 CSV file of results (`mooring_comparison.csv`)  
  - 📊 Plots: `cost_comparison.png`, `footprint_comparison.png`
